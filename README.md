# FlavorByte

Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible!

Welcome to FlavorByte! This repository houses a web application that provides a delightful experience for all food enthusiasts. FlavorByte leverages the power of the Spoonacular API to offer a variety of features, including displaying random recipes, educating about nutritional information for foods, searching for specific recipes, and presenting intriguing food facts.

## Description
This project was assigned to us to develop a custom application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API integration and what we wrote was entirely up to us. We ended up deciding on an application that allows you to search for recipes with a keyword, generate food and beer pairings, and search for random recipes or beers and leaving things up to chance.

## Features

### 1. Food Facts

We believe that learning should be as delightful as eating. That's why FlavorByte shares interesting food facts in the header of the application. Expand your knowledge and impress your friends with fascinating facts about the world of food!

### 2. Recipe Search

Craving something specific? Use our recipe search functionality to find the perfect recipe to satisfy your taste buds. Simply enter the name of the dish or a key ingredient, and FlavorByte will provide you with a curated list of 10 recipes to choose from, and give you some nutritional information about the dish. There are also some suggested.

### 3. Food and Beer Pairing

Looking for something to drink with your meal? Enter in what you are looking to make, such as pizza or cake, and you will get a beer that is matched for that recipe! If the beer does not suit your fancy, try again as there are many beers that pair with different recipes. 

### 4. Random Recipe Generation

Feeling adventurous? Throw caution to the wind and let us pick a new recipe for you! Flavor Byte offers a random recipe function to generate a recipe, allowing for all new possibilities!

### 5. Random Beer Generation.

Just like with the random recipes, Flavor Byte will generate a random beer and associated food pairings to help you plan your next dinner and drink option!

## Spoonacular API Integration

FlavorByte is powered by the Spoonacular API, a comprehensive food and recipe API that enriches our application with vast culinary knowledge. The API enables us to offer an extensive database of recipes, accurate nutritional information, and exciting food trivia.
